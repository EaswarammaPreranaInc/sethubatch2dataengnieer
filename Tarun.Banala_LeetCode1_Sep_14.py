#TARUN BANALA               LeetCode          14-09-2025(sunday)
'''You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

#Example 1:
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

#Example 2:
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]

#Example 3:
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
 

#Constraints:
The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9
It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros.'''

#ANSWER:

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

        current = dummy
        carry = 0
        
        while l1 or l2 or carry:
            # Get values from current nodes
            val1 = l1.val if l1 else 0
            val2 = l2.val if l2 else 0
            
            # Calculate sum and carry
            total = val1 + val2 + carry
            carry = total // 10
            digit = total % 10
            
            # Create new node with the digit
            current.next = ListNode(digit)
