1.
a = (25)
b = 25,
c = 25
d = (25,)

print(type(a))
# Output: <class 'int'>
# Explanation: The parentheses around '25' are used for grouping and do not create a tuple. 'a' is simply assigned the integer 25.

print(type(b))
# Output: <class 'tuple'>
# Explanation: The comma after the number is the key to creating a tuple with a single element.

print(type(c))
# Output: <class 'int'>
# Explanation: This is a standard integer assignment. 'c' is assigned the integer 25.

print(type(d))
# Output: <class 'tuple'>
# Explanation: This is the standard, unambiguous syntax for creating a tuple with a single element. The parentheses and the comma together define the tuple.

print(a * 4)
# Output: 100
# Explanation: 'a' is an integer, so this performs standard integer multiplication (25 * 4).

print(b * 4)
# Output: (25, 25, 25, 25)
# Explanation: 'b' is a tuple. The multiplication operator on a tuple performs repetition, creating a new tuple with the elements of 'b' repeated 4 times.

print(c * 4)
# Output: 100
# Explanation: 'c' is an integer, so this performs standard integer multiplication (25 * 4).

print(d * 4)
# Output: (25, 25, 25, 25)
# Explanation: 'd' is a tuple. The multiplication operator on a tuple performs repetition, creating a new tuple with the elements of 'd' repeated 4 times.



2.
a = list('Hyd')
print(a)
# Output: ['H', 'y', 'd']
# Explanation: The list() function takes the string 'Hyd' (which is a sequence of characters) and creates a new list with each character as an element.

print(type(a))
# Output: <class 'list'>
# Explanation: This confirms that the data type of the variable 'a' is a list.

print(len(a))
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The len() function returns the number of elements in the list 'a', which is 3.

b = (10, 20, 15, 18)
print(list(b))
# Output: [10, 20, 15, 18]
# Explanation: The list() function takes the tuple 'b' (a sequence) and converts it into a new list.

print(list(range(5)))
# Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
# Explanation: The range(5) function creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4. The list() function converts this sequence into a list.

print(list(25))
# Output: TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable
# Explanation: The list() function can only convert objects that are "iterable" (i.e., sequences like strings, tuples, lists, or ranges). An integer like 25 is not a sequence, so this conversion is not possible and a Type Error is raised.




3.
a = {25, 10.8, 'Hyd', True, 3+4j, None, 25, 'Hyd'}
print(a)
# Output: {True, None, 10.8, 25, 'Hyd', (3+4j)}
# Explanation: Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. The duplicate values (the second '25' and 'Hyd') are discarded. The order of elements in the output is not guaranteed and can vary between Python versions or runs. Note that 'True' is not treated as '1' here, so both are included.

print(type(a))
# Output: <class 'set'>
# Explanation: This confirms the data type of the variable 'a' is a set.

print(len(a))
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The len() function returns the number of unique elements in the set, which is 6.

print(a[2])
# Output: TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable
# Explanation: Sets are unordered and do not support indexing or direct element access. A Type Error is raised.

print(a[1 : 4])
# Output: TypeError: 'set' object is not subscriptable
# Explanation: Similar to indexing, sets do not support slicing. A Type Error is raised.

a[2] = 'Sec'
# Output: TypeError: 'set' object does not support item assignment
# Explanation: Sets are mutable, but they do not support item assignment by index because they are unordered. You must use methods like .add() or .remove().

print(a * 2)
# Output: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'set' and 'int'
# Explanation: The multiplication (repetition) operator is not supported for set objects.

print(a * a)
# Output: TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'set' and 'set'
# Explanation: Sets cannot be multiplied by other sets.





4.
a = [25]
print(a[1])
# Output: Index Error: list index out of range
# Explanation: The list 'a' has only one element at index 0. There is no element at index 1. Attempting to access an index that does not exist raises an 'Index Error'.

print(a[1:])
# Output: []
# Explanation: This is a slice operation. It attempts to create a new list containing elements from index 1 to the end. Since index 1 is beyond the end of the list, the slice is empty. Slicing does not raise an error when indices are out of bounds; it simply returns an empty list.




5.
a = {1, 'Hyd', False, True, 0.0, '', 1.0, 0}
print(a)
# Output: {False, 1, '', 'Hyd'} (The order may vary)
# Explanation: Sets store only unique elements. Python treats certain values as equal for uniqueness checks:
# - False, 0, and 0.0 are all considered the same. Only one is stored.
# - True, 1, and 1.0 are all considered the same. Only one is stored.
# - The empty string '' and the string 'Hyd' are unique.
# Therefore, the set contains only four unique elements: one for the group of zeros/False, one for the group of ones/True, and the two unique strings.

print(len(a))
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The len() function returns the number of unique elements in the set, which, as explained above, is 4.

print(type(a))
# Output: <class 'set'>
# Explanation: This confirms the data type of the variable 'a' is a set.






6.
a = []
print(a)
# Output: []
# Explanation: This prints the empty list that has just been created and assigned to the variable 'a'.

a.append(25)
a.append(10.8)
a.append('Hyd')
a.append(True)
# Explanation: These statements add the specified elements to the end of the list 'a'.

print(a)
# Output: [25, 10.8, 'Hyd', True]
# Explanation: This prints the list after the four elements have been appended.

a.remove('Hyd')
# Explanation: This statement removes the first occurrence of the element with the value 'Hyd' from the list.

print(a)
# Output: [25, 10.8, True]
# Explanation: This prints the list after 'Hyd' has been successfully removed.

a.remove('25')
# Output: Value Error: list.remove(x): x not in list
# Explanation: This statement attempts to remove the string '25' from the list. However, the list contains the integer 25, not the string '25'. Since the remove() method requires an exact match of the value and type, and the value '25' is not present, a Value Error is raised. The program stops at this point.

print(a)
# Output: (This line would not be reached due to the Value Error above)







7.
a = set('Rama rAo')
print(a)
# Output: {'R', 'a', 'm', ' ', 'r', 'A', 'o'} (The order may vary)
# Explanation: The set() function takes the string and converts it into a set of its unique characters. Case matters ('R' and 'r' are different), and spaces are included.

print(len(a))
# Output: 6
# Explanation: There are 6 unique characters in the string "Rama rAo".

print(set([10, 20, 15, 20]))
# Output: {10, 20, 15} (The order may vary)
# Explanation: The set() function converts the list into a set, automatically removing the duplicate 20.

print(set((25, 10.8, 'Hyd', 10.8)))
# Output: {10.8, 'Hyd', 25} (The order may vary)
# Explanation: The set() function converts the tuple into a set, automatically removing the duplicate 10.8.

print(set(range(10, 20, 3)))
# Output: {10, 13, 16, 19} (The order may vary)
# Explanation: The range() object is an iterable. The set() function converts it into a set of the numbers it generates.

print(set(25))
# Output: Type Error: 'int' object is not iterable
# Explanation: The set() function requires an iterable object (like a string, list, or tuple) as its argument. An integer is not iterable, so a Type Error is raised.

print(set([25, 10.8, [], 'Hyd']))
# Output: Type Error: unhashable type: 'list'
# Explanation: Set elements must be "hashable" (immutable). A list ([]) is mutable and is therefore not hashable. This causes a Type Error when the set() function tries to add it as an element.







8.
a = tuple('Hyd')
print(a)
# Output: ('H', 'y', 'd')
# Explanation: The tuple() function takes the string 'Hyd' (which is a sequence of characters) and creates a new tuple with each character as an element.

print(type(a))
# Output: <class 'tuple'>
# Explanation: This confirms that the data type of the variable 'a' is a tuple.

print(len(a))
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The len() function returns the number of elements in the tuple 'a', which is 3.

b = [10, 20, 15, 18]
print(tuple(b))
# Output: (10, 20, 15, 18)
# Explanation: The tuple() function takes the list 'b' (a sequence) and converts it into a new tuple.

print(tuple(range(5)))
# Output: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
# Explanation: The range(5) function creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4. The tuple() function converts this sequence into a tuple.

print(tuple(25))
# Output: Type Error: 'int' object is not iterable
# Explanation: The tuple() function can only convert objects that are iterable (i.e., sequences like strings, tuples, lists, or ranges). An integer like 25 is not a sequence, so this conversion is not possible and a Type Error is raised.







9.
a = (10, 20, 30)
print(a)
# Output: (10, 20, 30)
# Explanation: Prints the tuple 'a' as it is defined.

print(id(a))
# Output: [A unique memory address, e.g., 2049082728944]
# Explanation: This prints the unique memory address of the tuple object 'a'.

a = a * 2
# Explanation: The expression 'a * 2' performs tuple repetition, which creates a *new* tuple object (10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 30). Because tuples are immutable, the original object is not changed. The variable 'a' is then reassigned to point to this new object.

print(a)
# Output: (10, 20, 30, 10, 20, 30)
# Explanation: Prints the newly created, longer tuple that 'a' now references.

print(id(a))
# Output: [A new and different memory address, e.g., 2049082729900]
# Explanation: This prints the memory address of the new tuple object. This address will be different from the original one, proving that a new object was created and the variable was reassigned.








10.
a = []
b = ()
c = {}
d = set()

print(type(a))
# Output: <class 'list'>
# Explanation: The '[]' literal syntax creates an empty list.

print(type(b))
# Output: <class 'tuple'>
# Explanation: The '()' literal syntax creates an empty tuple.

print(type(c))
# Output: <class 'dict'>
# Explanation: This is a common point of confusion. The '{}' literal syntax creates an empty **dictionary**, not a set.

print(type(d))
# Output: <class 'set'>
# Explanation: The set() constructor must be used to create an empty set.

print(a)
# Output: []
# Explanation: Prints the empty list.

print(b)
# Output: ()
# Explanation: Prints the empty tuple.

print(c)
# Output: {}
# Explanation: Prints the empty dictionary.

print(d)
# Output: set()
# Explanation: Prints the empty set. Python's representation of empty set is 'set()' to distinguish it from the empty dictionary

a = set()
a.add(25)
a.add(10.8)
a.add('Hyd')
a.add(True)
a.add(None)
a.add('Hyd')
a.add(1)
# Explanation: These lines add elements to the set. Sets only store unique, hashable elements.
# - 'Hyd' is added once. The second `add('Hyd')` does nothing.
# - The integer `1` is considered equal to the boolean `True`. Since `True` was added first, the `a.add(1)` operation does not change the set's contents.
# The set `a` now contains 5 unique elements: {True, None, 10.8, 25, 'Hyd'} (order may vary).

print(a)
# Output: {True, None, 10.8, 25, 'Hyd'} (order may vary)
# Explanation: Prints the final set after all additions.

print(len(a))
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The set contains 5 unique elements.

a.remove(25)
# Explanation: This removes the element 25 from the set.

print(a)
# Output: {True, None, 10.8, 'Hyd'} (order may vary)
# Explanation: Prints the set after 25 has been removed. It now contains 4 elements.

a.append(100)
# Output: Attribute Error: 'set' object has no attribute 'append'
# Explanation: Sets do not have an `append()` method. You must use `add()` to add a single element. This error stops the program's execution. The remaining lines in the code will not be executed.






Tuple Operations in Python
python
a = ()
print(type(a))
# Output: <class 'tuple'>
# Explanation: This prints the data type of the variable 'a', which is a tuple.

print(a)
# Output: ()
# Explanation: This prints the empty tuple that was created using the tuple literal syntax `()`.

print(len(a))
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The `len()` function returns the number of elements in the tuple, which is 0 since it is empty.

b = tuple()
print(b)
# Output: ()
# Explanation: This prints the empty tuple that was created using the `tuple()` constructor with no arguments.

print(len(b))
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The `len()` function returns the number of elements in the tuple `b`, which is also 0.







List Slice Assignment and Memory Addressing in Python
python
a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(a, id(a))
# Output: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] [A unique memory address, e.g., 2049082728944]
# Explanation: This prints the initial list and its memory address.

a[1:4] = [60, 70]
print(a, id(a))
# Output: [10, 60, 70, 50] [The same memory address as before]
# Explanation: This is a slice assignment. The elements at indices 1, 2, and 3 ([20, 30, 40]) are replaced by the new list [60, 70]. The list is modified *in place*, so the memory address remains the same.

a[2:4] = [100, 200, 300]
print(a, id(a))
# Output: [10, 60, 100, 200, 300, 50] [The same memory address as before]
# Explanation: The list `a` is now `[10, 60, 100, 200, 300, 50]`. This statement replaces the elements at indices 2 and 3 ([70, 50]) with the new list [100, 200, 300]. The list is modified in place again, so the memory address does not change.
